# Optimization of algorithms for analyzing log files on batch systems

This code contains the project developed for the three-year thesis in Computer Engineering of the University of Bologna.

This thesis work presents an optimization work of a python algorithm for the analysis of log files of the StoRM system generated by the CNAF. The original code was written using the Pandas DataFrame and, to speed up the execution of the code, the algorithm was modified to run in parallel using the Dask libraries.
